His mother died when he was a boy. Growing up in the teeming streets of 17th century Paris, Jean Baptiste received a good Jesuit education and was fascinated by the street fairs and traveling carnivals that flourished in spite of the religious repression and hypocrisy of those cruel times. As a young man he joined the theatrical Bejart family to establish the Illustre-Theatre, which soon went bankrupt. The troupe reformed, found patronage, and went on the road for thirteen years, performing all over France. Poquelin developed his stagecraft adapting Commedia dell Arte plots to please brutalized peasants and cynical townspeople. He also married Madeline Bejart, the widowed daughter of the troupe's founder. Later he entered into a love affair with Mme Bejart's daughter, to the dismay of all. The troupe eventually returned to Paris and, on October 24, 1658, greatly impressed the 20-year old King Louis XIV, later to be called the Sun King. Moliere's life became bound up with the magnificent court at Versailles, and with its intrigues. He wrote, staged and acted in the plays now famous all over the world. He fought with his enemies and his friends, enjoyed success followed by failure, organized court festivities and defended himself against increasingly fanatic religious authorities.

His mother, Flora, suffers from depression. Michele, his father, is immature and absent. The situation becomes more complicated when Michele begins dating Lisetta, a girl he has known for years. Brando is asked to be complicit (to accept and manage that betrayal), which makes him very uncomfortable. When Michele finally leaves the house, Flora attempts suicide and never recovers from her psychosis. Brando then begins his most difficult period. In the past he was sent to his paternal grandmother who, despite her enormous affection for Brando, is no longer able to take care of him. Eventually, Brando is declared legally abandoned and is given to a family house (an orphanage). Michele accepts the court's decision. His reasons being that firstly, he does not want his son entrusted to his maternal grandparents in Catalonia, who Michele feels will not provide proper care to the boy. Secondly he wants to assuage Lisetta, who has recently moved into Michele's home, as she feels the same about the grandparents. The arrival in the family House puts Brando in a state of deep distress. He develops enuresis, which leads him to become the laughing stock of other children. Brando finds refuge in idolizing his heroes in Real Madrid and wrestling. One night he decides to escape and go to the hospital to visit his sick mother, but in the grip of her hallucinations and presumably still wrongly believing that Brando endorses the relationship between his father and Lisetta, she refers to him as a ""bad boy"" because she considers him an accomplice of the father. She also accuses him of theft in front of a nurse. The child hasn't heard from his grandmother, due to social workers declaring her as unreliable (or as implied, forgetting him), leading to the fact that she might have no way to contact him. After about a year of staying in the family home, Brando receives a proposal to go into foster care with the family of a man he knew whilst living in his former home. The couple had a son who passed away recently, and despite the affection that the couple and their relatives show Brando, the boy rejects them, fearing he will be abandoned again, and worried that the pair want him as a replacement for their deceased son. After a few months, Michele visits Brando, who expects good news, convinced that his father has come to take him home. Instead, Michele now seems totally uninterested in Brando, and is only excited at the arrival of a new child he is expecting with Lisetta. He reaffirms that he has no plans to take Brando back to his old home. Brando then agrees to be sent into foster care with the couple who had proposed to receive him, but not before he reiterates his desire that he not be considered a substitute for their dead son. Surrounded by the love that is in his new family, Brando becomes happy again."

Monks have been leading Tibet and Tibetans for generations, not only in religious, but also in worldly matters. But monks have vows that bind them. And often those vows conflict with the needs of politics. The Tibetan movement today is divided and weakened by an ongoing argument whether the Dalai Lama""s Middle Way Policy is the right strategy or not. Tibetans are torn between their religious beliefs and their desire to free their homeland. In November 2008, the Dalai Lama acknowledged for the first time the failure of his policy and that the situation for Tibetans in Tibet has worsened. His unprecedented call for a special meeting upon 500 Tibetan leaders from all over the world led to a discussion about the future of the movement and a way to re-unite all Tibetans behind one goal.—Dirk Simon"
